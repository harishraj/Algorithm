첫인사
Hello Tamara, My name is Hyogi Jung. Nice to meet you, too.
To tell you the truth, I'm a little nervous because I think that this is a great opportunity.
But I'll try my best.

왜 아마존인가? 내 목표는?
It is my dream to change the world for the better as software engineer, like where your team is now.
I want to be on the cutting edge of mobile platform. Through this, I want to build the most convenient and innovative ways to create the best shopping experience for millions of Amazon shoppers worldwide on their mobile devices.

이직하려는 이유?
I found that the position was not as challenging as I thought initially. Its service is limited in domestic.
I would want more interesting and challenges. What I mean is that I would like to participate in a global scale projects, like where your team is now.

자기 소개 : 여러 모바일 플랫폼에 대한 소개
I am really passionate about the Software Development Engineer role in your mobile shopping team.
So I prepare 3 things to have a better opportunity to join your company.

First, when I was a software engineer intern at Google, I was involved in developing core features and invent innovative ways for customers to interact with Amazon on their Google TV devices.

Second thing, I was involved in various mobile platform developments including Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile and Tizen. So I can go beyond traditional app development and build the next generation mobile platform for Amazon shopping.
Last but not the least; I have a high bar for code quality and professional knowledge in software engineering including code reviews, source control management, buid processes, testing etc (엑섹트라).

I am confident that the skills I possess(퍼제스), along with my enthusiasm(이쑤지에즘) and willingness to learn, would enable me to become an effective member of your team.

경력 및 인턴십 내용: 몇 년 동안인지, 무슨 일을 했는지 설명, 삼성소프트웨어 멤버십
I graduated from Seoul Nation University with a M.S. in Computer Science. During my college days I participated in an in internship programs for a global IT company, such as Google and Samsung electronics. I gained various experiences in customer relations.

어떤 언어에 익숙한지

C/C++/C
#, 최근에는 Android 개발을 많이 하기 때문에 JAVA를 많이 사용한다.

챌린징했던 일
The most challenging experience is developing the network statistics monitoring dashboard for Google TV devices from extremely large logs.
I’m quite familiar with server programming, network and database.
But it was quite hard for me because I had to use big data infrastructures such as map-reduce, flumejava, dremel, borg and plex.
It took many time to understand these infrastructures and design overall system.
So I divided it into 3 parts to solve more easily such as log analysis, scheduling and making dashboard.
I think it was the most challenging experience based on my experience in this field.

현재 하고 있는 일
I am currently a software engineer at KFTC which manages inter-bank payment systems in South Korea. I am in charge of developing the mobile payment applications such as banking application and NFC payments.
And I participated in developing a mobile service for transferring money via KakaoTalk, the nation’s leading mobile messenger.

회사에서 챌린징했던 일(개선한 일)
I established a system for automated testing to test android applications using robotium and spoon which are android test automation open source libraries. Our manager puts to test applications manually before releasing. Testing tasks can be laborious and time consuming to do manually.
So I proposed and implemented an automated testing system. Because of this, we can reduce the time to run repetitive tests from hours to minutes.

여기에서 어려웠던 일은?
My first approach was white-box test because we had source code and knew the resource id of certain elements. But there were some problems. We had to obfuscate the codes to release application to prevent tampering. So I had to change approach from white-box test to black-box test. To achieve this, I modified all source codes that uses index of the element rather than a resource id.

무슨 일을 하는 팀인가?
Your team build, launch and manage Amazon’s business on mobile websites and apps across all smartphone and tablet platforms.
And your team try to make it easy for a customer to go from idea to search, shop, and purchase in 30 seconds or less!
(Your team is responsible for creating the best shopping experience for customers wherever they go on their favorite mobile devices.)

대학원 때 전공은? 이게 어떤 연관이 있나? 네트워크, 미러링(중복해서 사용한다)
I has a Masters in Computer Science. During the graduate courses, I studied the computer network especially mobile network and future internet. So I fundamentally understood the mobile and wireless network.
These studies were helpful when I understood and implemented the network modules on the Google TV. I think it will be also helpful to play a major role in your team.

College project
When I was graduate student, I participated in Microsoft Imagine Cup 2011 which is the world's premier student technology competition.
We developed the social network service like twitter, facebook for a developing country to delivery news more quickly using existing radio. Because there wasn’t internet connection.
(In detail) In this project, I designed overall system and implemented the connection module between hardware part which is radio module and software part that is social network service.

장점: 성격적인 측면
My strongest points are time management, diligence(딜리전스), and strong sense of responsibility.
Simply said, I get things done on time and I never give up on my work.
I consider myself to be an ambitious person. I am never a quitter  I never give up until the job is done. I think my ------------- make me an excellent candidate for this job.

장점 및 구글에서 배운 내용
I always try to improve my programming ability and problem solving.
I read many others source codes and try to understand it.
Especially, I learned many things through collaborating with other engineers on code reviews.
I think these experiences will allow me to be a good software engineer who has professional knowledge such as coding standards, code reviews, source control management and etc(앤 엑섹트라).
Based on my experience in this field, I’m confident that I can benefit your company.

궁금한 내용

마무리 말 & 감사 인사
I was a pleasure to meet you. I look forward to the(디) opportunity to work for you.
I felt that I had not effectively shown you what I’m capable of.
But I've prepared a lot in order to obtain this opportunity.
There is one more thing, I haven’t had much practice in speaking in English at my prior experiences, but I received good results when I worked at Google and

취미, 여가 활용
I enjoy swimming every morning. This helps me relax and get the blood flowing. I also enjoy reading a good book. I recently read a book that related with Jack Ma.

데드라인을 못 맞춘 경우
Tell me some incidents when you haven’t meet the deadline and what do you have learn from that? Etc
Tell me a situation where you did not complete your work in given time.
개발 도중에 요구 사항을 계속 변경했다. 그래서 어쩔 수 마감시간을 연장해야만 했다.
Once when we were developing an application for an important feature, they kept adding features and changing features. We needed to incorporate all of their requests, we had to ask for about couple of days’ extension because of this. Fortunately, my boss was amenable to the extension and this was ultimately very successful.

I keep an evernote for my “things-to-do” for the day. This keeps my schedule under control on a daily basis, ensuring that I do not miss a deadline. As to deciding deadlines, I always give myself allowances, knowing that things may not always go as planned. Allowance for time gives me enough room to move, especially if the deadlines are very close.

동료가 어려움에 빠진 경우
한 번은 집안 사정으로 인해 회사 일에 많은 시간을 할애하지 못하였고, 급하게 해야 할 일들이 많았다. 당시 다른 일들을 하고 있었지만, 해당 부분을 한 경험이 있기 때문에 도움을 줄 수 있었다.
Once my co-worker missed some days because of funerals in his family during busy business period.

I think this often results in higher performance yield and profit for our company.

최신 기술을 어떻게 습득하는지
I always set apart some time every week to look over industry journals and to register the mailing list for industry news. I’ve already compiled a good list of web sites that seem to stay on top of what’s new in the industry. Znet. Cnet, techcruch, etc

영어 공부 어떻게 하는지
I like to listen English news or watch TED using smart phone application. This helps me to stay abreast on the current issues. And I learn English over the phone every day to improve my communication skills in English.

구체적인 설명? 기능을 추가하는 일, 이슈가 생겼을 때 대처하는 일 등
The secure access is important in the banking software. So all banking activities take place over the security structures such as End to End encryption. It prevents access to user transaction data. So I proposed

The more I searched this position, my interest in joining your team grew stronger.
